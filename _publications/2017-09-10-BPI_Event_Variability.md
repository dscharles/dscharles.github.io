Several business-to-business and business-to-consumer services are provided as a human-to-human conversation in which the provider representative guides the conversation towards its resolution based on her experience, following internal guidelines. Several attempts to automatize these services are becoming popular, but they are currently limited to procedures and objectives set during design step. Process discovery techniques could provide the necessary mechanisms to monitor event logs derived from textual conversations and expand the capabilities of conversational bots. Still, variability of textual messages hinders the utility of process discovery techniques by producing non-understandable unstructured process models. In this paper, we propose the usage of word embedding for combining events that have a semantically similar name.
