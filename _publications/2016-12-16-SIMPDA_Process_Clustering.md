In this paper we report a case study on the use of the cophenetic distance for clustering software developer behavior accessing to a repository. This distance was recently proposed for the comparison of tree-based process models. We show how hierarchical clustering techniques over the cophenetic distance are capable of detecting homogeneous clusters corresponding to well-defined software developer roles. The techniques have been evaluated on real-life data from a software development project, and the quality of the clusters over the cophenetic distance is compared with similar techniques in the literature.
