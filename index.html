Hey! Welcome to my website. I am David Sánchez, and I am a Senior Research Engineer at CA Strategic Research (CA Technologies). Due to the large number of researchers also known as David Sánchez, I had to enhance my signature with my second (<em>and coolest</em>) surname.

Under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.upc.edu/~jcarmona/">Prof. Josep Carmona</a> and Victor Muntés-Mulero, on September 18<sup>th</sup> 2017, I will defend my (industrial) Ph.D. thesis on Crowdsourcing and User Behavior Modeling. 

My research interests include process and data science, business process management, machine learning, artificial intelligence, anomaly detection on complex systems and crowdsourcing.
