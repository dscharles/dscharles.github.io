<p>Hey! Welcome to my website. I am David Sánchez, and I am a Senior Research Engineer at CA Strategic Research (CA Technologies). Due to the large number of researchers also known as David Sánchez, I had to enhance my signature with my second (<em>and coolest</em>) surname.</p>

<p>Under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.upc.edu/~jcarmona/">Prof. Josep Carmona</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vmuntes/">Victor Muntés-Mulero</a>, on September 18<sup>th</sup> 2017, I will defend my (industrial) Ph.D. thesis on Crowdsourcing and User Behavior Modeling. </p>

<p>My research interests include process and data science, business process management, machine learning, artificial intelligence, anomaly detection on complex systems and crowdsourcing. </p>
